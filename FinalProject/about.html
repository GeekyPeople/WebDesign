    <h3>Character Creation</h3>
<p>As a player, your part starts in character creation. The dm (dungeon master) will give you information on the worl or campaign you will be playing in. From there, you can now think about the type of character you want to play.</p>

<p>
Character creation involves a number of aspects to think about. You can create almost any type of character you can think of. Usually, you want to start with a concept of a character, who has their strong suits, as well as their flaws to work through. In a long standing campaign, you see your character grow both mechanically as well as personally.
</p>

<p>
    Within character creation, you pick your race, background, class, and any personable abilities that your character will start with. THis is something your dm can walk you through. There are a large number of race and backgrounds to choose from, with a more limited list of classes and subclasses.
</p>

<p>
    You also customize who your character is as an individual. What they look like, how they act and speak, even their likes and dislikes. For example, my most recent character is a Tiefling rogue/sorcerer, who has a propensity for chaos. She loves the outside and nature, and while smart and often has her nose in a book, would much rather be outside or enjoying time with her friends. Her darkest part of her past involvers her losing control over her magic which resulted in the death of her brother. She's short, with ram like horns, and a rather ditsy personality.

<h3>What Goes into Play?</h3>
        <p> Play within dnd can vary from session to session (the single day parts of the game) and from campaign to campaign (the overarcing game as a whole).</p>
        <p>There are a couple of main focus points to play in dnd: role-play, combat, exploration, and story.</p>
        <p> Each player has their own prefrences to how they like the session balance to be. Some like more combat, while some will like more role-play. You too will find what you prefer to do in a sesion. You also may like a lot of different aspects of it and how you want the campaign to follow may be changed based off of your character. </p>
