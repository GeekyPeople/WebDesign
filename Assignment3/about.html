    <h3>Character Creation</h3>
<p>As a player, your part starts in character creation. The dm (dungeon master) will give you information on the worl or campaign you will be playing in. From there, you can now think about the type of character you want to play.</p>

<p>
Character creation involves a number of aspects to think about. You can create almost any type of character you can think of. Usually, you want to start with a concept of a character, who has their strong suits, as well as their flaws to work through. In a long standing campaign, you see your character grow both mechanically as well as personally.
</p>

<p>
    Within character creation, you pick your race, background, class, and any personable abilities that your character will start with. THis is something your dm can walk you through. There are a large number of race and backgrounds to choose from, with a more limited list of classes and subclasses.
</p>

<p>
    You also customize who your character is as an individual. What they look like, how they act and speak, even their likes and dislikes. For example, my most recent character is a Tiefling rogue/sorcerer, who has a propensity for chaos. She loves the outside and nature, and while smart and often has her nose in a book, would much rather be outside or enjoying time with her friends. Her darkest part of her past involvers her losing control over her magic which resulted in the death of her brother. She's short, with ram like horns, and a rather ditsy personality.
