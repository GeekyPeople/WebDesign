<h1>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Dungeons and Dragons </h1>

<h2> A series by J.R.R Tolkien turned to worldwide experience </h2>


<h3>The Lord of the Rings (LotR) trilogy and corresponding books are the bases for all fantasy works. It has everything you want from a good story, adventure, good and bad, and some heartwrenching moments.
    
</h3>


<h3> 
    The Lord of the Rings led to many fantastic and unique fantasy worlds, and ways of expressing that sense of wonder and adventure. Dungeons and Dragons takes a lot of inspiration from J.R.R Tolkiens works, and making it into a table top RPG setting.

<h3>
    Dungeons and dragons has been a great bonding experience for my friends to be able to meet every week and explore different stories and settings. I have taken the role as Dungeon Master recently, walking my friends and their characters through their new jouney.

<h3>
    I would say that my favroite thing about dnd is the companionship you make along the way. You bond not only with your friends, but get to create characters who get to bond with other characters. You get to watch how the world and the other characters shape and grow them, from a new adventurer with a potentially dark past, to a nobel hero who has healed and grown since they started on their journey.
